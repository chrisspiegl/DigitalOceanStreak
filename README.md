# DigitalOceanStreak

[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=9822b155cd67) is an awesome hoster. This little script/site shows the longest interval they have been up without any problems (reported on their [status site](http://www.digitaloceanstatus.com/)).

# Installation

1. Clone repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm update`
4. `grunt`

The server will start on the specified port (in lib-coffee/config/server.coffee).
